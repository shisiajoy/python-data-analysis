# PYTHON-DATA-ANALYSIS-REPOSITORY

This repository documents my journey in Python data analysis, primarily focused on structured exercises and projects completed as part of my coursework. 

Hereâ€™s an overview of the notebooks:

  - Daily Practice: Consistent exercises in libraries like NumPy and Pandas, focusing on data manipulation, filtering, sorting, merging, and statistical analysis.

  - Weekly Projects: Larger datasets like US Crime Rates, Apple Stock, and World Food Facts for applying analytical skills to real-world scenarios.

    
## Notebook Highlights:

  - Pandas Projects: Analysis of diverse datasets i.e financial data to develop insights through filtering, grouping, merging, and visualization techniques.
    
  - NumPy Exercises: Foundational practice in mathematical operations and data structuring with NumPy.
